After learning about the websites and iOS apps that one of his friends built in his dorm room just for "fun", Charles began to develop an interest in programming. He was impressed that a coder could engineer such user-ready products virtually on his own. Although Charles did not have any coding experience in high school, he decided to attend Santa Clara University because of the school's strong computer engineering program and its connections with tech companies in Silicon Valley. Ultimately, Charles plans to combine his technical knowledge with his interest in business to lead and innovate products at a top tech company.</p>

On her down time she likes to catch up on sleep and the various TV shows she keeps up with as well as play a little game of softball with her friends. ACM-W is the place where Muna bonded with other women in the computer science who go through similar situations as herself in the male dominated field of engineering. She hopes with the help of her amazing board this year, ACM-W will be the space for women in the computer science and engineering to feel motivated and supported. </p>
